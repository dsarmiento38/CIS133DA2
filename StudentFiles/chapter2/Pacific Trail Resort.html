<h2> Stay at a quiet getaway</h2>

<p>The resort offers a quiet getaway, with luxary camping in yurts along with an upscale lodge for dining and visiting with fellow guests. The target audience for Pacific Trail Resort is couples who enjoy nature and hiking. Melanie would like a website that emphasizes the uniqueness of the location and accommediations, a reservation page with a contact form, and a page to describe the activities available at the resort.</p>
